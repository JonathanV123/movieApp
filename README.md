# Movie Calendar

Having enjoyed utilizing React on my To Do List application, I decided to build another React application that would be bigger in scope. This application features a custom built calendar that pulls in movie information and release dates via the theMovieDB API. I had an absolute blast designing and building the calendar logic while figuring out how to handle multiple AJAX calls to retrieve the appropriate information for each particular movie. I gained new found knowledge in higher-order functions, design paradigms, and ES6 by building this application.
